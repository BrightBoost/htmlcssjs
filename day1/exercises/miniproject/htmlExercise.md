### Instructions for Creating the HTML Part of the To-Do List App

Welcome to your first step in building a To-Do List app! In this section, we'll focus on creating the HTML structure for your app. HTML forms the backbone of your web application, providing the structure that CSS and JavaScript will build upon.

**MAKE SURE THAT YOUR PROJECT USES GIT FOR VERSION CONTROL AND IS UPLOADED TO A REPO ON BITBUCKET**

#### Step 1: Set Up Your Project

1. **Create a Project Folder:**
   - Create a new folder on your computer and name it `todo-list-app`.

2. **Create an HTML File:**
   - Inside your project folder, create a new file and name it `index.html`.

#### Step 2: Basic HTML Structure

1. **Open `index.html` in your text editor.**
2. **Add the Basic HTML Skeleton:**
   - The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines this document as HTML5.
   - The `<html>` element is the root element of the HTML document.
   - The `<head>` element contains meta-information about the document, like the character set and title.
   - The `<body>` element contains the content of the HTML document.

#### Step 3: Creating the Container

1. **Inside the `<body>` tag, add a `<div>` with the class `container`**
   - The `div` element with the class `container` will hold all the main content of your app.

#### Step 4: Adding a Title

1. **Inside the `div.container`, add an `<h1>` element for the app title**


#### Step 5: Creating the Task Form

1. **Add a `<form>` element for adding new tasks**

   - The `form` element will contain the input field and the submit button.
   - The `input` element is where users will type their tasks.
   - The `button` element will add the task to the list when clicked.

#### Step 6: Creating the Task List

1. **Add an unordered list (`<ul>`) to display the tasks:**
   - The `ul` element with the id `task-list` will hold the list of tasks.

#### Step 7: Save and Preview

1. **Save your `index.html` file.**
2. **Open `index.html` in your web browser to preview the structure.**
   - You should see a basic layout with a title, an input field, a button, and an empty list.

### Bonus Challenges

1. **Add a Description:**
   - Add a short description or instructions below the title to guide the users on how to use the app.

2. **Creative Freedom:**
   - Feel free to add additional elements or modify the structure to suit your creativity! For example, you could add:
     - A footer with your name or the date.
     - An image or icon next to the title.
