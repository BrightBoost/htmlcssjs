### Mini Project: API Integration and Frontend Development

In this mini project, you will put your newly acquired skills to the test by integrating an external API and building a frontend to display the data.

1. **Choose an API**:
   - Find an interesting API to work with. This could be a weather API, Pok√©mon API, joke API, or any other API of your choice. Let's refer to the subject of your chosen API as "XXX".

2. **Develop a Frontend**:
   - Create a frontend application to display the data retrieved from your API. Ensure that your project is stored in a BitBucket repository.
   - This is a fun project, so go wild with styling and functionality!

3. **Present**:
   - At the end of the day you'll present your project. Do give it your all to impress your colleagues and instructor!

### Bonus Challenges

- **Advanced Endpoints**:
  - Create additional API endpoints to retrieve a single item related to XXX or filter items based on specific properties. Customize this based on the capabilities of your chosen API.
  - Update your frontend to utilize these new endpoints and provide enhanced functionality for users.

- **Find your instructor if you need more bonus exercises!**
